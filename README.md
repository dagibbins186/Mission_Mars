# Mission to Mars
This project automates a web browser to visit websites about the Mission to Mars; it uses BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape news and full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres. The data is stored in a NoSQL database; MongoDB. The final step creates a web application with Flask, and displays the information from the web scrape.
